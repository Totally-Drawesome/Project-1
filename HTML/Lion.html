    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>The most social of all cats, lions keep in touch through roaring, which can be heard from up to five miles away.</li>
        <li>The lion's signature mane is believed to help protect their throats in battle; males with the darkest, shaggiest manes
            are often the oldest and strongest. The manes, however, are not strictly exclusive to males; there have been numerous reports of
            female lions with manes and males without. 
        </li>
        <li>Lion populations have declined by about 50% in the previous century. Though scientists don't fully understand this rapid
            decline, much of the lion's natural habitat has been lost to agriculture, which ulitmately results in human-animal conflict.
        </li>
