    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>The orca, also known as the killer whale for its predatory behavior, is the only cetacean known to prey upon other
            marine mammals, including other dolphins and whales.
        </li>
        <li>Though orcas are often considered a single species, there are a variety of ecotypes which occur in the North Pacific,
            North Atlantic, and the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica. Some ecotypes, however, are suspected to be possible subspecies,
            or even species of their own.
        </li>
        <li>Because of their cosmopolitan distribution, the overall population has been consitently difficult for scientists to
            calculate. In 2005, however, the southern resident orcas of British Columbia were placed on the US Endangered Species Act,
            due to threats such as pollution and overfishing.
