    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Gorilla troops are led by a dominant male known as the silverback, while males that lack the signature silver coloration 
            are referred to as "blackbacks."
        </li>
        <li>While not to the same extent as chimpanzees, gorillas are known to use tools, having been observed using sticks to 
            retrieve food or measure the depth of water.
        </li>
        <li>Though they are a common attraction in zoos, wild gorillas are continuously threatened by poaching, commercial logging,
            and especially the ebola virus, which has caused the most drastic reductions in gorilla populations. Conservation groups
            have worked diligently to protect this species, though the work has been extremely challenging, due to the gorilla's elusive
            nature and the severity of its threats in the wild.
        </li>
