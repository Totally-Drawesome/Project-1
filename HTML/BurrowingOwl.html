    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>Burrowing owls roost and nest in burrows that have been excavated by other mammals, such as prarie dogs and ground
            squirrels. </li>
        <li>To ward off predators, burrowing owls produce hissing and rattling sounds akin to those of a rattlesnake; this
            strategy is known as Batesian mimicry.</li>
        <li>Although the burrowing owl remains common in many Neotropical countries, it is considered a threatened species in 
            North America. A significant reason for this is habitat loss, as well as the eradication of many burrowing animals upon
            which the burrowing owl depends. Without a burrow to call home, these owls become more vulnerable to predation from 
            badgers, coyotes, and rattlesnakes.
