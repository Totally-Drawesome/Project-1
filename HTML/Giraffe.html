    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
        <li>In spite of their lofty appearance, giraffes have only seven bones in their neck, the same amount as humans. </li>
        <li>In order to establish mating privileges, male giraffes engage in a behavior known as necking, in which the two 
            participants slam their necks against one another. The compititions vary in intensity, and while they don't usually lead to
            serious injury, there have been records of these fights causing broken bones and even fatalities.
        </li>
        <li>Though giraffes have unfortunetly been extirpated in many parts of their range, they are still found in most national parks 
            and game reserves, and continue to be a common attraction in zoos across the globe.
        </li>
