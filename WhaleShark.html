        <li>The whale shark holds many records in the animal kingdom for its size alone. It is the largest living fish, as well
            as the third largest living sea creature after the fin whale and the blue whale.
        </li>
        <li>Despite the reputation of many shark species as ferocious man-eaters, the whale shark is a gentle giant. They only eat
            plankton and small fish, and are docile towards humans, even allowing swimmers to catch a ride on their back. Many 
            scientists however advise against this behavior, as whale sharks are still wild animals that deserve their personal space.
        </li>
        <li> In the wild, it is believed that whale sharks have an average lifespan of 100-150 years. Unfortunately very few whale sharks
            actually reach adulthood, due to the fact that it takes them 30 years to sexually mature, as well as the looming threats of
            overfishing, poaching, and pollution.
